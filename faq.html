		<hr>
        <font id="h5">Q. How do you process my clothes, where are my clothes headed?</font>
        <p>Ans: From your doorsteps, your clothes land directly to a top notch Laundromat, where they are scrutinized by our quality control manager and sacked in lots with only your clothes. We have state of the art machines which wash and dry your clothes. We then either do folding or steam pressing as per instruction given by you during pickup.</p>
        <font id="h5">Q. Do I need to separate clothes of laundry from dry clean?</font>
        <p>Ans: Our pick up riders have reusable laundry bags and you just need to tell our rider suitably about the segregation and our pick up rider will put your clothes in suitable bags.</p>
        <font id="h5">Q. Are there things that you will not wash?</font>
        <p>Ans: Not Much!!. If our laundry specialist discovers that it would not be sensible to wash a certain textile, we will contact you and agree on how to continue.</p>
        <font id="h5">Q. How do I give special instructions for my clothes?</font>
        <p>Ans: Be it a cold wash or a antiseptic wash or adding of fabric conditioner, we have this all covered for you. You can also mention about any adamant stain and we can arrange special treatment for them. You just need to mention it to our pick up rider and he will write it down in the special instruction column in pick up receipt.</p>
        <font id="h5">Q. What do you suggest to tackle clothes which bleed out color?</font>
        <p>Ans: Some dark coloured clothes have this tendency to bleed out color and white garments are most susceptible to adhering to this bled color. So we 
suggest not to give expensive white clothes in the lot for laundry. Dry cleaning expensive clothes is always a better and safe option.</p>
